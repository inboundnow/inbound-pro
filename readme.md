## Welcome to our Public Repository

Inbound Pro is the world's first WordPress plugin to offer a comprehensive set of [inbound marketing](https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing) tools for lead attraction, conversion, statistical profiling, and marketing automation. 

The Inbound Pro plugin includes and expands on the powers of our 3 most popular free plugins, [Landing Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/), [Leads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leads/), and [Calls to Action](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cta/),  so they will not need to be installed/activated if this plugin is installed. 

[It's free to get started with Inbound Pro.](https://www.inboundnow.com/?sign-up-now) We offer a strong free-user experience and an even stronger experience for [subscribers]("https://www.inboundnow.com/pricing")

# Development Builds

Inbound Pro Plugin includes [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) powered [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks that contributors should be aware of when editing any part of our `InboundAnalytics.min.js` file.

## Installing Dependencies

1. NodeJS & Gulp must be installed first! [see documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
2. Run `npm install` inside of the `/wp-content/plugins/inbound-pro/` directory.

## Gulp Tasks

These commands are performed inside of the the `/wp-content/plugins/inbound-pro/` directory. Each command might require `sudo` to be added before it to enable administrator permissions, depending on your OS.

### `gulp watch`

This command will monitor changes in `inbound-pro/core/shared/assets/js/frontend/analytics-src/` and compile the changes into our unified files located in `inbound-pro/core/shared/assets/js/frontend/analytics/`.

### `gulp GPL`

This command will extract Landing Pages, Calls to Action, and Leads plugin into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory as stand alone plugins. There's really no need for contributors to do this, but it helps us with preparing individual updates to the WordPress.org SVN repository.
